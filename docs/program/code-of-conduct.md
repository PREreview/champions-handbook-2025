# Participation Guidelines & Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and brave environment we, as leadership, contributors, and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of background, family status, gender, gender identity, or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race and/or ethnicity, caste, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location, and any other dimension of diversity.

## Expected behaviors
Example behaviors of PREreview Champions and all PREreview community members include:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Being open to different possibilities and being wrong
- Using welcoming and inclusive language. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives to be heard, and listen actively
- Providing feedback that is constructive
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Respecting the privacy and confidentiality of everyone in the community
- Maintaining kindness, professionalism, and integrity in all of your interactions
  
Particularly in the role of PREreview Champion, you act as a representative of PREreview, and your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our shared outcomes. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. These behaviors are expected regardless of whether the interaction occurs within our Slack Community, training workshops, via email, or any other online or in-person interaction as part of the PREreview community.   

## Prohibited behaviors
Examples of unacceptable behaviors by participants include, but are not limited to:

- Violence and threats of violence
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances;
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Providing unconstructive or disruptive feedback on PREreview
- Posting spam or irrelevant material
- Influencing unacceptable behavior
- Reviewing your own preprint
- Recording and/or sharing content from PREreview training sessions and events without permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting   

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported by filling out our [report form](https://bit.ly/PREreview-report) with the option to be anonymous, emailing report@prereview.org, or by messaging **@safety** on the PREreview Community Slack. In the report, please describe the violation of this Code of Conduct and the context in which it occurred. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be for us to act on the reported misconduct.   

If you email us, please use **“Code of Conduct Violation Report”** as your subject line. If you decide to report the violation via the form and you wish us to follow up with you, please be sure to include your email address at the end of the form.   

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response determined by the **PREreview Safety Team**. The PREreview Safety Team consists of PREreview’s Executive Director, Head of Community, Head of Product, and Head of Technology. To view the complete response protocol, please refer to our [Code of Conduct](https://prereview.org/code-of-conduct) page on the PREreview website. Please note that Code of Conduct violations may result in you no longer being allowed to participate in the PREreview Champions Program.
